# Abstract
In the era of Next Generation Sequencing and beyond, the Sanger technique is still widely used for variant verification of inconclusive or ambiguous high-throughput sequencing results or as a low-cost molecular genetical analysis tool for single targets in many fields of study. Many analysis steps need time-consuming manual intervention. Therefore, we present here a pipeline-capable high-throughput solution with an optional Shiny web interface, that provides a binary mutation decision of hotspots together with plotted chromatograms including annotations via flat files based on R and Nextflow.

## Availability

All components of the PARrOT R package and the belonging Python scripts are available for download from the Github repository [PARrOT](https://github.molgen.mpg.de/loosolab/PARrOT/).

### Installation

To install the R-package the following commands have to be executed in R.

```r
install.packages(c("BiocManager","stringr","ggplot2","reshape2","seqinr","devtools")
BiocManager::install(c("Biostrings","CrispRVariants","biomaRt","sangerseqR"))
library("devtools")
install_github("https://github.com/kaischmid/SangeR")
```
