# Abstract
In the era of Next Generation Sequencing and beyond, the Sanger technique is still widely used for variant verification of inconclusive or ambiguous high-throughput sequencing results or as a low-cost molecular genetical analysis tool for single targets in many fields of study. Many analysis steps need time-consuming manual intervention. Therefore, we present here a pipeline-capable high-throughput solution with an optional Shiny web interface, that provides a binary mutation decision of hotspots together with plotted chromatograms including annotations via flat files based on R and Nextflow.
